        <h1>⚠️ Public Service Warning: JOIN THIS SERVER!!! Dsc.gg/rbi</h1>
        <p>This page documents concerning behavior from the administrator of a specific Discord server. We advise users to exercise extreme caution.</p>

        <div class="warning">
            <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This server is complete dogshit, you should leave.
        </div>

        <h2>Documented Unprofessional Conduct</h2>

        <p>The server owner, who also acts as the developer, has demonstrated a pattern of toxic and unprofessional behavior.</p>

        <h3>Evidence of Being Gay ASF/h3>
        <p>This is how DEV is <strong>GAY</strong>.</p>

        <div class="evidence">

            <p><em>Image: Him being gay.</em></p>
        </div>

        <h3>Why This is a Problem:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>This is how he creates a bad environment for his devs including me.</li>
            <li><strong>Shows Poor Leadership:</strong> A good leader would let his devs show they're scripts.</li>
            <li><strong>Indicates Unreasonable Expectations:</strong>Punishing a user, by demoting them but they we're sharing they're script.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>About the Developer</h2>
        <p>The individual behind this server, who uses the handle "<strong>is dev</strong>," is responsible for this environment. Their actions, as shown above, call into question their judgment and suitability for managing a community.</p>

        <h2>Our Recommendation</h2>
        <p>Based on this documented behavior, we strongly recommend that you <strong>do not join</strong> this server. Engaging with a community led by someone who exhibits such toxic behavior can be a negative and stressful experience.</p>

        <p>You have been warned. Protect your peace online.</p>
